# Auto Aurora Banquet Cooker  
> *A NovaDev Project*

Automate Aurora banquet cooking without constantly babysitting ratios or ovens.  
This script uses **image recognition and OCR** to detect ovens, manage cooking states, and keep things running smoothly.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

> **Use at your own risk.**  
> Macros **may be considered a bannable offense**. I take **no responsibility** for any consequences resulting from use of this script.

**Strongly recommended setup:**

- Set your **GUI Scale to 75%**

- Keep **a bit of each berry** in your inventory  
  > OCR may struggle with multi-line item names and will backup to alternatives.
- Avoid having **active quests with sparkle/particle effects**  
  > These can interfere with OCR detection.

## How It Works

The script relies on **image recognition** to locate ovens and **OCR** to read cooking states and ingredients.  
Environmental consistency is critical for reliable detection.

---

## Environment Setup (Very Important)

### 1. Dark Walls
Surround your ovens with **dark-colored walls**.  
Black or very dark materials work best and significantly improve detection accuracy.

### 2. Long Roof
Sunlight, glare, and lens flare can cause false detections.  
A **long roof** helps block direct light and stabilizes recognition.

---

## Tips to Reduce Detection Errors

- Make your ovens and surrounding area **as dark as possible**
- Wear **dark clothing**
- Avoid outfits or accessories that emit:
  - Sparkles
  - Glows
  - Particles or trails

These effects can confuse both image recognition and OCR.
